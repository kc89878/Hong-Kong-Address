# Data Processing Project - Hong Kong Common Spatial Data Infrastructure

This project aims to process and extract address data from the Hong Kong Common Spatial Data Infrastructure (空間數據共享平台). The dataset consists of various geographic and residential information across 18 districts, including public rental addresses.

## Overview
With the increasing demand for accessible and reliable data, this project utilizes open-source data to facilitate the extraction and transformation of geographic information for use in data warehousing. By converting GeoJSON files into Excel (XLSX) format, the project makes it easier to analyze and manipulate the data.

## Features
Data Extraction: Seamlessly reads and processes multiple GeoJSON files containing address data.
Data Transformation: Converts GeoJSON format to a structured Excel format for easier data manipulation and analysis.
Batch Processing: Automatically processes multiple files in a single run, saving time and effort.
